# EGU23_GM3.3_ls_benchmark

We share our Python scripts and Jupyter notebook for our presentation at the [General Assembly 2023 of the European Geosciences Union](https://egu23.eu) as part of the session [GM3.3 Benchmark datasets for landslide susceptibility zonation](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/session/47046).

The Jupyter notebook in this repository provides a step-by-step guide on how we analyzed the benchmark dataset.

The scripts in this repository are designed to help users analyze and visualize the data in the benchmark dataset.

*Note*: To run the scripts you will need the [EU-DEM v1.1](https://land.copernicus.eu/imagery-in-situ/eu-dem/eu-dem-v1.1) raster (E40N20).
We provide a shapefile with additional derived parameters (su_benchmark_updated.shp).

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

The initial call for collaboration is available [here](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/4719/).
